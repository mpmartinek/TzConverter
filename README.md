# TzConverter

A simple Timezone Converter app. Allows you to add cities to your list of time zones and live convert the time for you. The list of cities is saved in a postgres DB, and your selection of cities is written right in the DB. Each instance of this app is intended for one user only. The ecto setup contains a seed with a couple dozen cities. If you'd like to add more, you can simply expand the seed (/priv/repo/seeds.exs) list following the same format. Use Tzdata.zone_list() inside iex to get a list of compatible cities (I've pre-exported it for you in /cities), as some cities are not considered 'time zone cities'. If you'd still like to add your own city to the Timezone Converter app, you can simply enter your city name into :city_name, and then enter the nearest time zone city into :time_zone. Enjoy!
